We study the relative risk of value and growth stocks. We find that
time-varying risk goes in the right direction in explaining the value premium.
Value betas tend to covary positively, and growth betas tend to covary
negatively with the expected market risk premium. Our inference differs from
that of previous studies because we sort betas on the expected market risk
premium, instead of on the realized market excess return. However, we also find
that this beta premium covariance is too small to explain the observed
magnitude of the value premium within the conditional capital asset pricing
model.
